//  Detects whether this device can DECODE HEVC (incl. 10-bit / HDR10), so we advertise HEVC/4K to
//  kino.pub only where the stream will actually play. When HEVC+4K are on, kino.pub serves HDR titles
//  as an HDR10-only master (10-bit HEVC Main10, VIDEO-RANGE=PQ) with NO SDR fallback. A device that
//  can decode that plays it fine — AVPlayer tone-maps HDR10 down on SDR displays,
//  so true-HDR display capability is NOT required, only 10-bit HEVC decode. The Simulator can't decode
//  it and shows the native player's "unplayable" crossed-out play, so it's excluded explicitly.
